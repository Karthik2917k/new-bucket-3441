        We believe in a world where you have total freedom to be you, without
        judgement. To experiment. To express yourself. To be brave and grab life
        as the extraordinary adventure it is. So we make sure everyone has an
        equal chance to discover all the amazing things they’re capable of – no
        matter who they are, where they’re from or what looks they like to boss.
        We exist to give you the confidence to be whoever you want to be.

      <h1>Fashion democracy</h1>
      <h1>Choice for all</h1>
      <p>
        Our audience (AKA you) is wonderfully unique, and we do everything we
        can to help you find your fit. We offer our ASOS Brands in more than 30
        sizes – and we're committed to providing all sizes at the same price –
        so you can be confident we’ve got the perfect thing for you.

      <h1>Body positivity</h1>
      <p>
        It’s important for us to promote a healthy body image – we’re not about
        conforming to any stereotypes – so we work with more than 200 models to
        represent our audience. And we’re not in the business of digitally
        altering their appearance either… there’s no reshaping or removing
        stretch marks here. Our models are part of the ASOS family and we
        support them by following a Model Welfare Policy.

      <h1>ParalympicsGB partnership</h1>
      <p>
        We’re more than honoured to be an official partner of the British
        Paralympic Association, providing the ParalympicsGB team with their
        formal and ceremonies outfits. Creating bespoke collections that meet
        the athletes’ needs, as well as making them look and feel great, is a
        privilege and has improved our learning about designing adaptive
        clothing.

      <h1>ASOS Marketplace</h1>
      <p>
        You know that satisfying feeling when you stumble across an incredible
        vintage boutique, or uncover an amazing independent brand, before
        everyone else? Yeah, we love that too. That’s why we created ASOS
        Marketplace in 2010. The team seeks out the best fashion start-ups, so
        you can shop one-of-a-kind finds all the time.

      <h1>PEOPLE AND THE PLANET</h1>
      <br />
      <h1>People</h1>
      <p>
        We’re serious about making sure every person in our global supply chain
        is safe at work and has their rights respected and protected. We set
        high ethical standards and support our suppliers to help them meet them.
        Our priorities include transparency; improving wages; health and safety;
        addressing and reducing modern-slavery risks, and identifying and
        stopping child labour.

      <h1>Planet</h1>
      <p>
        We’ve set ourselves ambitious targets to reduce the impact we have on
        the planet and we’re always looking for new ways to get better. We also
        work hard to ensure animals don’t suffer for fashion and have strict
        sourcing guidelines for animal-derived materials and producing
        animal-free products.

      <h1>ASOS Foundation</h1>
      <p>
        We set up the ASOS Foundation because we believe everyone deserves
        access to the same opportunities. It achieved full charity status in
        2013 and provides infrastructure, training and support to enable
        disadvantaged young adults to reach their potential. Our mission is to
        inspire young people to break down barriers and, ultimately, to achieve
        amazing things. We have so many experts in fashion and tech who love to
        pass on their talent through the Foundation – it’s one of our favourite
        parts of being ASOS, and we hope we can change lives.
